Place your twig template files into these folders as-needed.
Many of these exist in the D324 parent theme, look there first and
copy them here to override display

Note the use of COMPONENT LIBRARIES in the D324 theme templates...
The idea is to keep the twig files as sparse as possible, and let the
component library functions do the majority of the work.  That will
keep the theme somewhat platform/language agnostic, and make future
improvements, iterations, and porting easier.

So, whenever possible, try to use the given D324 component library
functions to build your resultant output.  Add your own seperately
name-spaced component library files under src/components for anything
that the D324 parent theme doesn't cover.

This concept is known as "Presenter Templates":

Someday, perhaps, we will be able to directly use component libraries
all on their own, and ditch the twig presenter templates entirely.
